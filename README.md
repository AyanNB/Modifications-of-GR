# Modified_TOV_solver_fortran
Code on Fortran to the "Note on how modifications of GR at high densities affect astrophysical compact objects"

Here the folders mean:

poly_s - Polytropic equation of state with Semiclassical corrections 

poly_t - Polytropic equation of state with Torsional corrections

mit_s - MIT equation of state with Semiclassical corections

mit_t - MIT bag equation of state with Torsional corrections

real_s - Realistic equation of state with Semiclassical corrections 

real_t - Realistic equation of state with Torsional corrections

Realistic equation of state is taken from paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0049.
