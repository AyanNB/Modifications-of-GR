# Modified_TOV_solver_fortran
Code on Fortran to the "Note on how modifications of GR at high densities affect astrophysical compact objects"

Here the folders mean:

*poly_s* - Polytropic equation of state with Semiclassical corrections 

*poly_t* - Polytropic equation of state with Torsional corrections

*mit_s* - MIT equation of state with Semiclassical corections

*mit_t* - MIT bag equation of state with Torsional corrections

*real_s* - Realistic equation of state with Semiclassical corrections 

*real_t* - Realistic equation of state with Torsional corrections

Realistic equation of state is taken from paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0049.
